# Add-Two-Numbers

LeetCode Q # 2.

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

</div>

>Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]</br>
>Output: [7,0,8]</br>
>Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.</br>

Example 2:

>Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]</br>
>Output: [0]</br>

Example 3:

>Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]</br>
>Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
